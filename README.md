[00:09.48] If you ask a stupid question
[00:12.09] Then you'll get a stupid answer
[00:15.11] And if you ask if I'm okay I'm unhappy ever after Hmph!
[00:19.71] If you ask me how I'm coping
[00:22.03] I'm like a minute from disaster
[00:25.30] I got so damn good at pretending, that I could win a BAFTA
[00:54.30] 
[00:29.87] My world's spinning the wrong way round
[00:32.13] Yeah, I'm smiling, but I'm lowkey down
[00:34.84] Tryna find something to laugh about, ah
[00:54.34] 
[00:39.56] Oh, ain't it funny how
[00:41.11] I seem fine but I'm depressed
[00:43.22] I look so pretty but I'm a mess
[00:45.94] I think I'm immune to happiness
[00:48.41] Oh why?
[00:49.85] Oh, ain't it funny?
[00:51.23] I wanna be brave, I'm terrified
[00:53.58] To get myself dressed and go outside
[00:56.22] I say I'm okay, I'm fine
[00:58.14] All jokes aside
[01:05.64] 
[01:00.33] If I don't laugh, I'll cry, cry, cry
[01:05.34] If I don't laugh, I'll cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
[01:28.34] 
[01:10.82] I don't want no conversation
[01:13.55] I'm not good around new people
[01:16.59] I'd rather stick to what I know
[01:18.51] And watch Malcolm in the Middle
[01:34.01] 
[01:20.99] Feeling lonely when I'm in a crowd
[01:23.59] Treading water, trying not to drown
[01:26.16] Tryna find something to laugh about, ah
[01:45.66] 
[01:31.05] Oh, ain't it funny how
[01:32.40] I seem fine but I'm depressed
[01:34.55] I look so pretty but I'm a mess
[01:37.11] I think I'm immune to happiness
[01:39.80] Oh why?
[01:41.15] Oh, ain't it funny?
[01:42.53] I wanna be brave, I'm terrified
[01:44.82] To get myself dressed and go outside
[01:47.45] I say I'm okay, I'm fine
[01:49.48] All jokes aside
[01:56.98] 
[01:51.64] If I don't laugh, I'll cry, cry, cry
[01:56.68] If I don't laugh, I'll cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
[02:01.84] If I don't laugh, I'll cry, cry, cry
[02:07.05] If I don't laugh, I'll cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
[02:30.05] 
[02:12.39] Oh, ain't it funny how
[02:13.80] I seem fine but I'm depressed
[02:16.45] I look so pretty but I'm a mess
[02:18.44] I think I'm immune to happiness
[02:20.91] Oh why?
[02:22.53] Oh, ain't it funny?
[02:23.86] I wanna be brave, I'm terrified
[02:26.15] To get myself dressed and go outside I say I'm okay, I'm fine
[02:30.65] All jokes aside
[02:38.15] 
[02:32.90] If I don't laugh, I'll cry, cry, cry
[02:38.06] If I don't laugh, I'll cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
[02:43.10] If I don't laugh, I'll cry all night
[02:48.19] If I don't laugh, I'll cry for the rest of my stupid life
